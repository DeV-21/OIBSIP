## `PROJECT NAME`
EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

## `PROBLEM STATEMENT`
We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get started!


## `Tech Stack`
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Programming Language: Python
