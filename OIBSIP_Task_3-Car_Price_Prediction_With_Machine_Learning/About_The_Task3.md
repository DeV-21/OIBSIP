## `PROJECT NAME`
CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

## `PROBLEM STATEMENT`
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
