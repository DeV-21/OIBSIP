## `PROJECT NAME`
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

## `PROBLEM STATEMENT`
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning. 

## `Tech Stack`
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Programming Language: Python
